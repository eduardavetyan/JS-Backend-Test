# JS-Backend-Test

Create photo gallery API using NodeJS

#### Functionality we must implement

- We must have an endpoint for uploading, editing, deleteing, getting list of images (CRUD)
- User must see only his own uploaded images, also they can give access to each other's images.
- User must authorize with username and password, so we must have Sign in and Sign up functionality (Facebook Authorization will be a plus)
- Each photo must have title, location, date

Please consider that we will have billions of photos, please think about how you will save photos, for best performance and scalability.

Do as much as you can and send us the code in archive (.zip) or in GIT for review.
